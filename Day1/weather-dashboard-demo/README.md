Here’s a README.md file for the Day 1 project, OpenWeather-API-Demo:

# 🌦️ OpenWeather API Demo - Day 1 of #DevOpsAllStarsChallenge 🌟

This project is part of the **30-Day DevOps All-Stars Challenge**, focusing on building a weather dashboard that interacts with the **OpenWeather API** and AWS S3 to fetch, process, and store real-time weather data. 🚀

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- 🐍 **Python**: Core scripting language for handling API requests and cloud interactions.
- ☁️ **AWS S3**: Cloud storage for saving weather data in JSON format.
- 🌦️ **OpenWeather API**: Fetches real-time weather data for specified cities.
- 📦 **Boto3**: AWS SDK for Python to programmatically manage S3 buckets and objects.
- 🔐 **dotenv**: Securely manages environment variables for API keys and configurations.
- 🖥️ **Command-Line Interface**: Built with `argparse` for dynamic control.

---

## ✨ **Features**
1. **Fetch Weather Data**:  
   - Retrieves weather information such as temperature, humidity, and conditions for specified cities using the OpenWeather API.

2. **Save Data to AWS S3**:  
   - Stores the fetched weather data in AWS S3 in a structured JSON format, including timestamps for organization.

3. **Dynamic CLI Options**:  
   - Supports actions like running the program or deleting the S3 bucket via command-line arguments.

4. **Bucket Management**:  
   - Automatically creates the required S3 bucket if it doesn’t exist and can delete it when no longer needed.

## 📜 **How to Use**
### **Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wesleyfranks/OpenWeather-API-Demo.git
   cd OpenWeather-API-Demo

	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Create a .env file to store your environment variables:

touch .env

Example .env file:

OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name


	4.	Set up AWS credentials to interact with S3:
	•	Refer to AWS CLI Configuration.

Run the Program
	•	Fetch weather data and save it to AWS S3:

python weather_dashboard.py run


	•	Delete the S3 bucket and its contents:

python weather_dashboard.py delete

🌟 Highlights from the Challenge
	-	Dynamic Weather Retrieval: Fetches weather data for Houston, Austin, and Dallas in real-time.
	-	Error Handling: Improved resilience for API failures and bucket operations.
	-	Resource Cleanup: Ensures AWS resources are cleaned up properly using the delete action.
